Varsity Spirit serves Cheer and Dance customers from Scholastic (College, High School, Middle School) and Club (Cheer Gyms, Youth Cheer) Customer Segments. For this case, consider customers as the team,
not individual athletes. Varsity Spirit has three key Product Segments: 1) Apparel (e.g., uniforms, shoes), 2) Camps (e.g., clinics, overnights), and 3) Competitions.

Objective: Varsity Spirit wants to increase the number of customers participating in multiple product segments – for instance, sign an “Apparel Only” customer up for a camp to become an “Apparel + Camp” customer, or get a customer attending only camp (“Camp Only” customer) to register for a Competition (“Camp +
Competition” customer). The hypothesis is that when customers participate in an additional segment, they will not only spend more overall but will also spend more within each segment. For instance, apparel only customers who then attend a camp will also now spend more on apparel.

Considerations: From 2020 to 2022, has Varsity Spirit been successful in moving customers into additional Product Segments within the Scholastic Customer Segment? Is it true that customers who are active in multiple Product Segments both spend more overall
and spend more within each Product Segment?

## Executive Summary - Key Findings
1. From 2020 to 2022, the majority of Varsity Spirit customers (1192 customers: 60.42%) have remained exclusively within their initial product segment, without expanding into additional segments.
2. During this period, 27.42% of customers, totaling 541 individuals, diversified their purchases by adding at least one additional product segment.
3. Conversely, 12.16% of customers, comprising 240 individuals, reduced the count of product segments they engaged with.
4. In 2020, Varsity Spirit had 258 customers purchasing in all 3 product segments. This figure increased by 57 customers to 315 in 2021 (0.03% increase of all customers). In 2022, an additional 35 customers joined, bringing the total to 350 customers purchasing in all 3 product segments (0.02% increase of all customers).

5. Customers who engage in multiple product segments demonstrate higher overall spending, as evident in the visualizations below. The substantial increase observed in competition sales warrants further analysis.
6. In 2022, customers actively participating in two product segments exhibited an average spending of $14,322.36 on apparel. In contrast, customers exclusively purchasing in apparel had an average spending of 6,426.83. This reflects an average difference of 7,895.53.
